CIS 11 Course Project for Team 2
Option B: Test Score Calculator
	
Program: Create an LC-3 program that displays the minimum, maximum and average grade of 5 test scores and display the letter grade associated with the test scores. 
Input: User is prompt to input the test scores.
Output: Display maximum, minimum, average scores and letter grade equivalence (0 – 50 = F, 60 – 69 = D, 70 – 79 = C, 80 – 89 = B, 90 – 100 = A) on the console.

The program must fulfill the following criteria:
1.	Contain appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output. (20 points)
2.	Display minimum, max, average values/grades in console. (20 points)
3.	Use appropriate labels and comments. (20 points)
4.	Contain appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations. (40 points)
5.	Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls. (20 points)
6.	Use branching for control: conditional and iterative. (30 points)
7.	Manage overflow and storage allocation. (20 points)
8.	Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack. (20 points)
9.	Include save-restore operations. (30 points)
10.	Include pointer (20 points)
11.	Implement ASCII conversion operations (30 points)
12.	Use appropriate system call directives. (10 point)
13.	Testing (20 points): Test the program using the below values: 52 87 96 79 61
